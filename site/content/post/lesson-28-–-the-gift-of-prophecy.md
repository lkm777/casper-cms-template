title: Lesson 28 – The Gift of Prophecy
date: '2021-02-03T23:37:16+02:00'
---
1. How does God choose to reveal himself?

 **Amos 3:7 “Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret**

**unto his servants the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__.”**

 **NOTE**: God's methodology in revealing Himself is through the prophets.

2. What is one way in which God communicates His will?

 **Numbers 12:6 “And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a \_\_\_\_\_\__**

**among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a \_\_\_\_\_\_, and will speak**

**unto him in a \_\_\_\_\_\_.”**

** NOTE**: God will speak to prophets in dreams and in visions.

3. Will God's last day people have the prophetic gift?

** Revelation 12:17 “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war**

**with the remnant of her seed, which \_\_\_\_ the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_, and have the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**of \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\___.”**

** NOTE**: According to the Bible, God's last day people will have the testimony of Jesus.

4. What exactly is the testimony of Jesus?

 **Revelation 19:10 “And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See**

**thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of**

**Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the \_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”**

 **NOTE**: It is abundantly clear from the book of Revelation that God's last day church will

have the gift of prophecy. Therefore, God's Church in the last days will have the prophetic gift

in its midst.

5. I thought that the prophetic gift has been abolished after the cross, isn't that what the Bible

teaches?

 **Ephesians 4:8,11-13 “Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led**

**captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. And he gave some, apostles; and some,**

**\_\_\_\_\_\__; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting**

**of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: \_\_\_\_ we all**

**come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect**

**man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:”**

 **NOTE**: No, the prophetic gift will last until the end of time, till we all come into the unity of

 the faith. The purpose of the gift of prophecy is to strengthen the church. Aren't you glad 

that God's calls prophets? I am happy that He loves us so much to do that.

6. Will the church come behind in any gifts as it awaits the second coming of Christ?

** 1 Corinthians 1:4-7 “I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of**

**God which is given you by Jesus Christ; That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all**

**utterance, and in all knowledge; Even as the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\_\_ was confirmed in you: So**

**that ye come behind in \_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:”**

 **NOTE**: No, the church will not come behind in any gift as the second coming

draws near.

7. What does God challenge us to do when it comes to the prophets?

** 1 John 4:1 “Beloved, believe not \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_, but ___ the spirits whether they**

**are of God: because many \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\__ are gone out into the world.”**

 **NOTE**: God challenges us to try, or test those who claim to be prophets. How do

we test if prophets are true or not? By, the Bible of course.

8. What will true prophets always lead people to do?

 **Deuteronomy 13:1-4 “If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of**

**dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass,**

**whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not**

**known, and let us serve them; Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or**

**that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love**

**the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall \_\_\_\__**

**after the LORD your God, and fear him, and \_\_\_\_\_ his \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__, and obey**

**his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.”**

 **NOTE**: A true prophet will always lead people to keep the commandments of

God. A true will never teach anything that is contrary to the commandments of God.

9. What is the success rate of true prophets when they prophesy?

** Jeremiah 28:8-9 “The prophets that have been before me and before thee of**

**old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and**

**of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the**

**prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent**

**him.”**

 **NOTE**: A true prophet is 100% accurate unless the prophecy given is of a

conditional nature.

10. What is one indication that someone is a false prophet?

** Isaiah 8:19-20 “And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that**

**have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek**

**unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak**

**not according to \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_, it is because there is no \_\_\_\_\_\_ in them.”**

 **NOTE**: A false prophet will teach things that are not according to the word of

God or the law of God. If a so called prophet teaches that Sunday is sanctified or sacred, that

person is a false prophet.

11. Is there any connection between the gift of prophecy and the ten commandments?

If so, what connection is there?

** Ezekiel 7:26 “Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon**

**rumour; then shall they seek a \_\_\_\_\_\_ of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_; but the \_\_\_\_ shall \_\_\_\_\_\__ from**

**the priest, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from the ancients.”**

 **NOTE**: When the Children of Israel were rebellious and stopped obeying the

commandments of God, the prophetic gift was removed. And it is also true if people became

obedient the prophetic gift would be reinstated.

12. Who do true prophets put their emphasis on?

 **1 John 4:1-3 “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but \_\_\_\_ the spirits whether**

** they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.**

** Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ that \_\_\_\_**

** \_\_\_\__ is come in the flesh is of God: And every spirit that confesseth not**

** that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that**

**spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even**

**now already is it in the world.”**

** NOTE**: A true prophet will lift Jesus up as mankind's only hope.

13. What doesn't a true prophet do when in vision?

** Daniel 10:17 “For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my**

**lord? For as for me, straightway there remained \_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\__ in me,**

**neither is there \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ left in me.”**

** NOTE**: When a true prophet goes into vision they lose strength initially later it is

regained in a supernatural manner (See Daniel 10:18). But, perhaps the most compelling

sign is that a true prophet will not breathe when in vision. That is something the devil cannot

counterfeit.

14. What are a prophets divine credentials?

**Matthew 7:15-16 “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's**

**clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them**

**\_\_ \_\_\_\_ \_\____. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?”**

**NOTE**: A true prophet will exemplify the virtues of a Christian life. A true prophet will

not be proud and boastful, like many supposed prophets are today.

15. What happens to a person when they believe what a true prophet says?

**2 Chronicles 20:20 “And they rose early in the morning, and went forth**

**into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat**

**stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants**

**of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be**

**established; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ his \_\_\_\_\_\_\__, so shall ye \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”**

**NOTE**: If a person believes a true prophet and does what a true prophet says then

prosperity will be seen in that persons life. Prosperity in all things in their life.

16. Where does God place true prophets?

**1 Corinthians 12:27-28 “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in **

**particular. And God hath set some in the \_\_\_\_\_\__, first apostles,**

**secondarily \_\_\_\_\_\__, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of**

**healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.”**

**NOTE**: God has placed prophets in the church, to help guide the church.

17. Who is the prophet for the Remnant of Revelation 12:17?

 After the great disappointment of 1844, many who believed in the return of Christ were

 disillusioned and prepared to abandon their faith. Just prior to 1844, two men received

 similar visions regarding the advent movement. The first was William Foy, a member of

 the “Freewill Baptist Church” who was studying for the ministry. In 1842, in Boston, he

 witnessed the reward of the faithful and the punishment of the wicked, and the great

 scenes of the judgment in three steps: the books of record in heaven, the coming of

 Christ, and the reward of the faithful in that sequence. Foy related these visions to

 audiences, but when he received a third vision, which he did not understand, he ceased

 his public work.

 Hazen Foss also received a vision regarding the experience of the advent people, but

 refused to make it public after the great disappointment which had severely affected

 him.

 Shortly after this period, a young girl by the name of Ellen Harmon was given a vision

 of the trials of the advent people. This vision was given her two months after the great

 disappointment in December 1844. The vision did not reveal the reasons for the

 disappointment, but did offer comfort and greater understanding of the events as they

 had and would be unfolding.

 The events covered by the vision showed Adventists traveling to the city on a narrow

 path with the bright light of the “midnight cry” behind them, and the path lighted to its

 end so that they would not stumble. Those who kept their eyes on Jesus would not

 stumble but enter into the city, the New Jerusalem. She witnessed

 the events of the Second Advent and the sealing of the 144 000, the ascent to the New

 Jerusalem and the reward of the faithful.

 When Ellen Harmon related her first vision early in 1845, Hazen Foss was present and

 was overwhelmed that the vision was the same as he had received, but which he had

 refused to reveal.

 From 1844, when Ellen Harmon was 17 years old, until 1915 when she died, she

 had more than 2000 documented visions. During this time, she lived and worked in

 America, Europe, and Australia. Her work was often met with skepticism and ridicule,

 particularly since she was a woman and had not had much formal schooling in view of

 an accident in her youth, which had left her partly debilitated.

 At the age of nine, Ellen was seriously injured by a stone thrown by a classmate

 whilst she was on her way home from school. For three weeks, she was unconscious, and

 it was thought that she would not recover. After her initial recovery, she returned to

 school, but never got beyond the early grades.

 Ellen was a member of the Methodist church and was baptized on June 26, 1842. She

 was an ardent student of the Bible, and after attending meetings held by William Miller

 and his associates, she was impressed by the message which she heard. After the great

 disappointment, which also greatly affected her,

 she was chosen to receive her first vision and she relates her reaction as fol-

 lows:

“After I had the vision, and God gave me light, He bade

me deliver it... but I shrank from it. I was young, and I

thought they would not receive it from me.”(Ellen

G. White, letter 3, 1847)

 On August 30, 1846, Ellen married James White, a young Adventist preacher, and they

 had four sons: Henry, Edson, William and Herbert. After the death of her husband on

 August 6, 1881, Ellen labored alone for another 34 years, during which time some of the

 most profound writings on the word of God were produced by her. Her ministry and

 visions:

1. Guarded the church against fanatical influences, and the

 inroads of non-biblical doctrines,

2. Established the pillars of the Adventist faith in confirming or

 correcting the results of ardent Bible study by a host of advent believers. These

 pillars included the role of the Law of God, the Sabbath, the

 Sanctuary, the Second Coming of Christ, the three angel’s messages,

 and the identity and role of Babylon in the great controversy between

 Christ and Satan.

3. Established church order and directed the ministry on the

 spreading of the final message of hope and reproof, the Three Angel’s

 Messages.

4. Established the publishing work and helped it expand into

 a worldwide ministry.

5. Established the right arm of the ministry, a worldwide health

 message that recognizes that man has physical as well as spiritual needs.

 Despite her physical frailness and debilities which made it impossible for her to write,

 Ellen White became one of the most prolific writers for our time. No other woman author

 has produced as much published religious material, as has Ellen G. White. Numerous

 books, magazine articles, tracts and pamphlets as well as letters have flowed from her

 pen. Her writings cover a wide field of issues from doctrinal practices to Christian living,

 diet and health, parental care and guidance, education, medical ministry and the 

 illumination of Biblical prophecies and historic events. This remarkable turn of events

 was, according to her, made possible by the direct intervention of God. After being

 instructed to write down the things she had seen in vision, she had felt it

 an impossible request. She relates the experience as follows:

The Lord has said, ‘Write out the things, which I shall

give you.’ And I commenced when very young to do this

work. My hand that was feeble and trembling because

of infirmities became steady as soon as I took the pen in

my hand, and since those first writings, I have been able

to write. God has given me the ability to write... That

right hand scarcely ever has a disagreeable sensation.

It never wearies. It seldom ever trembles. (MS 88a, 1900)

18. What must we do concerning Ellen White?

** NOTE**: Ellen White is the only prophet in modern history who satisfies all the

 Biblical criteria of a prophet of God. She wrote pointed testimonies and

 received instructions from God that were to provide the necessary guidance for God’s

 remnant at the end of time. Those who take this instruction to heart will develop a greater

 understanding of the will of God and will be led into a closer relationship with God.

**IS IT YOUR DESIRE…**

Since the Bible describes the prophetic gift as the testimony of Jesus, this is not about Ellen G.

White, but it is about the message of Jesus through this woman. Would you be willing to test

her through reading her works and comparing to what is written in the Word of God? **Yes or No**
