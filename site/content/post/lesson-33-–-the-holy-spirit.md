Lesson 33 – The Holy Spirit

1. What is the Holy Spirit?

**John 16:7 “Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go**

**away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I**

**depart, I will send ___ unto you.”**

**NOTE**: Many times the Holy Spirit is referred to as an “it”, but this is not

Biblical. The Holy Spirit is referred to as “He” in the Holy Scriptures.

This text also tells us that He is our Comforter.

2. What is the work of the Holy Spirit?

**John 16:8 “And when \_\_ is come, \_\_will reprove the world of ___, and of**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:”**

**NOTE**: The Holy Spirit reproves (convicts) of sin, righteousness and judgment.

The Holy Spirit will convict you of what is wrong, and right. He will also impress

you with the consequences of your choices – judgment. God is doing everything

He can to save us. All of heaven is on our side.

3. What is the Holy Spirit part of?

**Matthew 28:19, 20 “And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power**

**is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all**

**nations, baptizing them in the name of the \_\_\_\_\_\__, and of the \_\_\_\_, and of**

**the \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\__: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have**

**commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the**

**world. Amen.”**

**NOTE**: The Holy Spirit (Ghost) is part of the Godhead. Father, Son and Holy

Spirit. He is the third person of the Godhead.

4. Does the Holy Spirit have emotions?

**Ephesians 4:30 “And \_\_\_\_\_\__ not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are**

**sealed unto the day of redemption.”**

**NOTE**: The Holy Spirit can be grieved, He is grieved when we sin. Grieving the

Holy Spirit is a very dangerous thing to do. When we continually grieve the Holy

Spirit, His power is diminished in our lives. On the flipside, His power is

strengthened in our lives when we follow what God has said.

5. Will the Holy Spirit always strive with humanity?

**Genesis 6:3 “And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always \_\_\_\_\_\_ with**

**man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty**

**years.”**

**NOTE**: The Holy Spirit will not always strive with humanity. When the Holy

Spirit first begins to impress you to follow Bible truth, putting it off is a very

dangerous option. The best time to do the will of God is when you first find out

what God’s will is. This will strengthen the voice of the Holy Spirit in your life

making it much easier to follow His guidance.

6. On a practical level, what does the Holy Spirit do in our lives?

**Galatians 5:22-26 “But the \_\_\_\_ of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,**

**longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against**

**such there is no law. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with**

**the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.**

**Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one**

**another.”**

**NOTE**: The Holy Spirit works out in our life the characteristics of Jesus Christ.

7. What kind of spirit does the Holy Spirit give us?

**Ezekiel 36:26-27 “A ___ heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put**

**within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will**

**give you an heart of \_\_\_\_\_. And I will put my \_\_\_\_\_ within you, and cause**

**you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them .”**

**NOTE**: God has promised that He will give us a new heart and that He will cause

us to walk in his statutes. He will give us a new spirit – a spirit that is completely

different than the spirit of this world. This world has a spirit of selfishness, the

Spirit of God is a spirit of selflessness.

8. Did the Holy Spirit participate in the act of creation?

**Genesis 1:2 “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was**

**upon the face of the deep. And the \_\_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\__ moved upon the face of**

**the waters.”**

**NOTE**: Yes, the Holy Spirit was an active participant in the act of creation and

recreation.

9. What does the Holy Spirit guide us into?

**John 16:13-14 “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide**

**you into \_\_\_ \_\_\___: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall**

**hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall**

**glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.”**

**NOTE**: The Holy Spirit does not lead a person into blind emotionalism. The Holy

Spirit is always consistent with Biblical truth. Some say, that “the Spirit told

them this”, or that the Spirit told them that”, but the Spirit of God always is in

harmony with what the Bible says. If the Spirit is telling you something contrary

to the Bible, be rest assured, it is not the Holy Spirit.

10. What does God use in order to teach His children?

**John 14:26 “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father**

**will send in my name, he shall \_\_\_\__ you all things, and bring all things to**

**your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, whatsoever I have said unto you.”**

**NOTE**: The Holy Spirit teaches us all things pertaining to living the Christian life,

and brings all things to our remembrance what Jesus has taught. Our

responsibility is to flood our minds with the truths of God’s word so that the Holy

Spirit can bring it can back as it is needed.

11. What is it called when someone rejects the Holy Spirit persistently?

**Matthew 12:31-32 “Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and**

**blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ against the Holy**

**Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word**

**against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh**

**against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,**

**neither in the world to come.”**

**NOTE**: Many wonder, “What is the unpardonable sin?” The unpardonable sin, is

the sin that is not confessed to God. When is the best time to confess our sins to

God? When we are first convicted of those sins. Why? Because the longer one

waits when convicted, the more difficult it becomes to confess those sins.

Consider the words of Jesus, “Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the

light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he

that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.” (John 12:35)

12. What do we become as we follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit?

**Romans 8:14 “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the \_\_\_\_**

**of \_\_\_\_.”**

**NOTE**: It is very interesting that many people today believe that humanity is

intrinsically good. The Bible speaks otherwise. The Bible calls humanity in its

degenerate state as, “children of wrath.” (See Ephesians 2:3) But, when we are

born again, or when we are led by the Spirit of God, we are sons of God. If we are

truly led by the Spirit of God, that “Spirit of God” is the “Spirit of Truth.”

Therefore, “the Spirit of God,” will lead us into “all truth.” Do you desire to 

know truth? Then you are being led by the Spirit of God.

**IS IT YOUR DESIRE…**

To follow the truth as you know it, and not harden your heart against the

promptings of the Holy Spirit? **Yes or No**
