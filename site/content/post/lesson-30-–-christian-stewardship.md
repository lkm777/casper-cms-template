1) Who is the one that gives us ability to acquire wealth?

**Deuteronomy 8:18 “But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he**

**that giveth thee \_\_\_\_\_ to get \_\_\_\_\__, that he may establish his covenant**

**which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.”**

**NOTE**: God is the one who gives us the power or the ability to make a living for

ourselves.

2) To whom does the Earth belong?

**Psalm 24:1 “The earth is the \_\_\_\_\_\__, and the fullness thereof; the world,**

**and they that dwell therein.”**

**NOTE**: The earth belongs to the Lord. It is His by creation and by redemption.

3) To whom does all the gold and silver belong?

**Haggai 2:8 “The \_\_\_\_\_\__ is mine, and the \_\_\_\__ is mine, saith the LORD of**

**hosts.”**

**NOTE**: God is the one who owns the earth, and all the silver and the gold. Since

He is the one who gives us the power to get wealth, we are only stewards of what

we have. Therefore, there is no such thing as an Owner’s Manual! You may have

one in your car glove compartment, but it should be called a Stewardship Manual!

We don’t own anything on this earth; we are only stewards of God’s resources.

4) What does God challenge us to do?

**Malachi 3:8-11 “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say,**

**Wherein have we robbed thee? In \_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\___. Ye are cursed with**

**a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes**

**into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and \_\_\_\_\_\_ me**

**now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of**

**heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to**

**receive it . And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not**

**destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before**

**the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.”**

**NOTE**: God challenges us to prove Him, or test Him, with the tithes and offerings

question. He promises that if we give a faithful tithe and offering He will pour

out a blessing so broad and deep we will not be able to receive it.

5) What happens to us when we honor God first?

**Matthew 6:33 “But seek ye \_\_\_\_ the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;**

**and \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\__ shall be added unto you.”**

**Proverbs 3:9-10 “Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ of all thine \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and**

**thy presses shall burst out with new wine.”**

**NOTE**: There is a blessing pronounced if we honor God first. Some people

decide to pay their tithe after they pay the bills. In doing so they are robbing

themselves of a true blessing. When we seek God’s Kingdom and His

righteousness first, everything else will be added to us. It doesn’t necessarily

mean our life will be filled with untold riches, but it does mean that we will be

taken care of in all aspects of our life, and will never lack anything.

6) What does the word tithe mean?

**Leviticus 27:32 “And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of**

**whatsoever passeth under the rod, the \_\_\_\_\_\_ shall be holy unto the LORD.”**

**NOTE**: The word “tithe” simply means, “a tenth of.” So, let’s consider this

challenge that God gives to you and I. God owns everything. He owns all the

earth, the animals, the silver and the gold on and beneath the surface of the earth.

Nothing is really ours. But God says to us, “All I ask of you is to return to me a

tenth of the money you earn.” That is a great deal if you ask me!

If you were going to negotiate terms in a business partnership, and your potential

business partner turned to you and said, “I want to join with you, but before I do,

let me just say that I want 10% of what this company earns, and you can keep the

rest of it.” I don’t know about you, but I would sign on the dotted line with a

business partner like that! God is only asking us to return a tenth back to Him. It

is His money anyway, and if we return it back as He asks, He gives back to us

blessings so broad and deep we cannot receive them all. This is the deal of a

lifetime!

But, I have even better news for you, God also wants to bless each of us even

more. God also speaks of a “freewill offering.” This offering comes from the

attitude of gratitude we have toward God and His love for us. The most exciting

part about the offering is, “The more you give to Him, the more you will receive

back!” Your life will be abundant and thriving.

7) Did Jesus endorse tithing?

**Matthew 23:23 “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay**

**tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters**

**of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have \_\_\_\_, and not**

**to leave the \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\____.”**

**NOTE**: Jesus is speaking of the hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees. They

were paying tithe in the minutest details, but yet they were forsaking the very

foundation of true religion. Please note, that Jesus did not say that tithing is bad,

but that they should have done it, but not leave the others undone.

8) What does God love?

**2 Corinthians 9:7 “Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let**

**him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a \_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\__.”**

**NOTE**: Granted, God loves everyone, but He especially delights in those who

give cheerfully. If we have an attitude like this, “I am only giving because I have

to, or it is expected of me.” This is an attitude of the flesh. But, if our attitude is,

“I am so grateful that I have the opportunity to give back to God.” That attitude is

one He looks highly upon. Why? Because that attitude is born from above, not

our own selfish, carnal hearts.

9) What should those who preach the gospel live off of?

**1 Corinthians 9:13-14 “Do ye not know that they which minister about holy**

**things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are**

**partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_ the gospel should live of the \_\_\_\_\_\___.”**

**NOTE**: God ordained that those who preach should be supported by the very

gospel they present. This is not “prosperity theology,” but this is an organized,

systematic way that those who share Jesus with others can continue their work.

10) How can the Christian be constantly blessed?

**Proverbs 11:24-25 “There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is**

**that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul**

**shall be made \_\_\_: and he that watereth shall be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ also himself.”**

**NOTE**: Fat and watered in this sense is not negative at all, but rather it literally

means, “satisfied.” When you give back to God what is already His, you will be

satisfied.

11) What divine financial principle still applies today?

**Deuteronomy 14:22 “Thou shalt truly tithe all the \_\_\_\_\_\__ of thy seed, that**

**the field bringeth forth \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\__.”**

**NOTE**: Some people say, “I can’t afford to tithe.” This is a strange statement.

The truth of the matter is, “I cannot afford not to tithe!” Blessed money, is much

better than cursed money. And when you follow God’s principles in financial

matters your increase will be blessed.

12) What will happen to you if you follow God’s principles of stewardship?

**John 13:17 “If ye know these things, \_\_\_\__ are ye if ye do them.”**

**NOTE**: By following God’s counsel in these matters you will be happy if you are

pleasing him. Why not test God today in your finances? Why not give back to

Him what is His already, by giving a faithful tithe and a freewill offering. God

will bless you for it!

**IS IT YOUR DESIRE…**

I want to test God by giving back to Him what is already His. **Yes or No**
