title: Lesson 21 – The Truth about Death

1) How did Jesus refer to death?

John 11:11-14 “These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our

friend Lazarus \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__; but I go, that I may awake him out of \_\_\_\__.

Then said his disciples, Lord, if he \_\_\_\__, he shall do well. Howbeit Jesus

spake of his \_\_\_\_\_\_: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in

\_\_\_\__. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is \_\_\_\_.”

**NOTE: Jesus referred to death as a sleep. In fact, in over 50 places in the Bible**

**death is referred to as a sleep.**

2) If death is referred to as a sleep, when do those who sleep the sleep of death wake

up?

1 Thessalonians 4:15-16 “For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not

prevent them which are \_\_\_\_\_\__. For the Lord himself shall descend from

heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of

God: and the dead in Christ shall \_\_\_\_ first:”

**NOTE: The good news is that those who have died and have accepted Jesus as**

**their Lord and Savior are not forgotten by God. When Jesus comes the second**

**time, they will be awakened by the sound of the trumpet and will come bursting**

**forth from the tomb with bodies that will no longer be subject to disease and**

**death. What a day that will be!**

3) How many resurrections does Jesus speak of?

John 5:28-29 “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which ___

that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that

have done good, unto the resurrection of ___; and they that have done evil,

unto the resurrection of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__.”

**NOTE: Jesus did not speak of only one resurrection, but two. The question we**

**will be exploring is: when will these two resurrections take place? Will they take**

**place at the same time or will they take place at different times? We will allow**

**the Bible to explain itself.**

4) How did God originally create human beings?

Genesis 2:7 “And the LORD God formed man of the \_\_\_\_ of the ground, and

breathed into his nostrils the breath of \_\_\_\_; and man \_\_\_\____ a living soul.”

**NOTE: In order to fully understand the subject matter in question, we need to go**

**back to see how man was created in the beginning. Man was formed from two**

**distinct components: the dust of the ground, and the breath of life. The result of**

**this union was that, “man became a living soul.” This is a point that cannot be**

**overstated. Many, today, are told that man receives a soul, but the Bible teaches**

**very plainly that, “man became a living soul.” Why is this so important? We will**

**look at the reasons why later in this study.**

5) What happens when a person dies?

Ecclesiastes 12:7 “Then shall the \_\_\_\__ return to the earth as it was: and the

\_\_\_\_\_\_ shall return unto God who gave it.”

**NOTE: When a person dies, the process that happened during the creation of man**

**is reversed. The dust that God used to form man returns to the earth. And the**

**spirit that God breathed into the nostrils returns to God. But what is this spirit? Is**

**it a ghostlike entity that flutters into heaven? The following verses will shed light**

**on this vital question.**

6) What is this spirit that returns to God at death?

Job 27:3 “All the while my \_\_\_\_\_\__ is in me, and the \_\_\_\_\_\_ of God is in my

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_;”

**NOTE: The Bible here is not describing a ghost in someone’s nostrils. That**

**would be ludicrous. This writing style is known as “Synonymous Parallelism”. It**

**was the main way in which Hebrews expressed poetry. The essence of this**

**writing style is very simple. It states something in one way and then expresses the**

**same thing in a different way. For example, in the verse above, breath and spirit,**

**have the same meaning. So this sheds much light on the question. The spirit that**

**returns to God is the breath of life. This is the precise reason why even with all**

**the cutting-edge medical technology, the brightest of the brightest scientist cannot**

**create life. To be 100% sure, let’s look at another verse that spells it out even**

**more plainly.**

Genesis 7:22 “All in whose \_\_\_\_\_\__ was the \_\_\_\_\_\_ of life, of all that was in

the dry land , died.”

**NOTE: It is very plain in this verse. There is no mistaking it. The breath of life is**

**in the nostrils. So, the concept that a ghostlike separate entity goes to heaven at**

**death is not a Biblical concept. It was actually borrowed from the pagan religions**

**of the past and adopted into Christianity by the beast power.**

7) What happens to the mind of a person when the breath of life goes back to God?

Psalm 146:3-4 “His \_\_\_\_\_\_ goeth forth, he returneth to his \_\_\_\__; in that

very day his thoughts \_\_\_\_\_\__.” 

**NOTE: So, when a person dies they cannot think anymore. Their thoughts die**

**with them. Their thoughts perish.**

8) If a person who dies cannot think, then can a dead person ever speak?

Matthew 12:34 “O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good

things? for out of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ of the \_\_\_\_\_\_ the \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__.”

**NOTE: The word heart in this verse and in many other places in the Bible is the**

**same as mind. So the principle that Jesus lays out here is very interesting. In**

**other words, “Whatever is in your mind, will come out of your mouth.”**

**Therefore, if the dead cannot think, then the dead cannot speak. So, when there is**

**a story about someone who died and they came back to talk to the living, then**

**who is talking? Is it the person who died? No! The Bible is crystal clear that the**

**dead cannot speak to the living.**

9) Who only has immortality?

1 Timothy 6:16 “Who \_\_\_\_ hath \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, dwelling in the light which no

man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be

honour and power everlasting. Amen.”

**NOTE: Immortality is not something that man has within. He does not have a**

**spirit or soul that is immortal. In fact, out of 1600 references in the KJV of the**

**Bible not once is the phrase immortal soul used. God is the only one who has**

**immortality. Therefore He is the only one who can bestow that gift.**

**10) When does Jesus bestow the gift of immortality?**

1 Corinthians 15:51-54 “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep,

but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the

last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__, and we shall be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. For this corruptible must put on

incorruption, and this mortal must put on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__. So when this

corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on

immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is

swallowed up in victory.”

**NOTE: The gift of immortality is given at the second coming of Jesus. There are**

**a few exceptions to this, of course. The Bible teaches that Enoch, Moses, Elijah,**

**and the 24 elders are in heaven now. The vast majority of humanity who have**

**died, are peacefully sleeping a dreamless sleep awaiting the blast of the trumpet.**

11) Do the dead praise God?

Psalm 115:17 “The \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\____ not the LORD, neither any that go down

into silence.”

```
NOTE: Most of the Christian world today believes that when a person dies they
```

```
immediately go to heaven. If that is so, then why does the Bible say the dead do
```

```
not praise the Lord? They are not praising the Lord because they are sleeping in
```

```
their graves. When you really think about it, this makes the most sense. Let’s
```

```
suppose that tragedy strikes a young married couple. The husband dies in a car
```

```
accident, and he is immediately in heaven. After a while the wife remarries, and
```

```
her new husband abuses her physically. Would heaven be a place of joy and bliss
```

```
for her former husband? Absolutely not! In fact, it would be torture for him to
```

```
watch what is taking place with his wife. God’s way is the only way that makes
```

```
rational, logical sense. We sleep in the graves and our next conscious thought is
```

```
the coming of Jesus.
```

12) Where is King David now?

Acts 2:29, 34 “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the

patriarch David, that he is both \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\____, and his sepulchre is with

us unto this day…For David is \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ into the heavens.”

NOTE: King David was a man that made mistakes, but David repented and was

forgiven by God. So, if it is true, like many say, and the dead are in heaven, then

David should be there. But, he is not. The Bible says that he is, “dead, buried,

and not in heaven.” It is very clear from the Bible that the dead are sleeping in

their graves until the resurrection morning.

13) Can souls ever die?

Ezekiel 18:4 “Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the

soul of the son is mine: the \_\_\_\_ that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it shall \_\_\_.”

NOTE: Yes! Souls die! The phrase immortal soul is not biblical. (See Genesis

2:7)

14) Why does the devil want us to be confused about what happens after death?

2 Corinthians 11:14 “And no marvel; for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ himself is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ into

an \_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\__.”

NOTE: It is on this very point that the devil will deceive billions of people. If

people do not know the Biblical truth about death then they will believe a lie and

be deceived when the devil transforms himself into an angel of light. Imagine, if

you will, all the pictures you have ever seen of Jesus. Long hair, handsome, tall,

and so forth. This is the image that people have in their mind when Jesus is

mentioned. Suppose you are watching your high definition television one evening

and all of the sudden there is an interruption. A news anchorman is seen at his

desk, and he gives the following news report: “Ladies and Gentleman: Here is the

latest news report: Jesus Christ has returned! This is the most glorious news that

the world has ever heard! He is in Berlin, Germany, right now speaking to large

crowds of people, quoting scripture and healing all the sick that are brought to

Him! The message that He is bringing to the masses is that all are saved if they

simply listen to the teachings of the church and do exactly as the church says.”

What if the disciples of Jesus also appear and give the same message? Many will

be led astray at this time. It will be the crowning act of the devil to deceive as

many as possible.

15) What is the ultimate cost for sin?

Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is \_\_\_\_\_\_; but the \_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_ is eternal

life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

NOTE: The ultimate cost for sin is death, eternal death. But, because of Jesus’

great sacrifice it does not have to be. Jesus Christ died so that we don’t have to

pay the penalty for our sins.

16) What will Jesus bring with Him when He comes?

Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is with me,

to give every man according as his work shall be.”

NOTE: By faith eternal life can begin now, but it will not reach its consummation

until Jesus comes the second time. Those who have given themselves completely

to Jesus will be at peace in their heart when He comes again.
