1) How should we, as Christians, respond to the problem of anger?

Hebrews 4:13 “Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight:

but \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_ are naked and \_\_\___ unto the eyes of him with whom we have

to do.”

Ephesians 4:26 “Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your

\_\_\_\__:”

NOTE: We should be very open before the God of the Universe, because He

knows all about us and our feelings and actions. So we should be very sincere in

our communication with Him, and tell Him all about our weaknesses.

2) What very important question should we ask ourselves?

Genesis 4:6 “And the LORD said unto Cain, \_\_\_ art thou wroth? and \_\_\_ is

thy countenance fallen?”

NOTE: The same question that God asked Cain, is the same question we should

ask ourselves when we find we are angry. And that question is: Why? Why, do

we become angry? This question is a piercing one, and it will lead us to really

begin to be honest with ourselves about who we are and how we feel.

3) What should we not let our emotions do to us?

Proverbs 16:32 “He that is \_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\___ is better than the mighty; and he

that \_\_\_\_\_\_ his \_\_\_\_ than he that taketh a city.”

Ecclesiastes 7:9 “Be not \_\_\_\_ in thy spirit to be \_\_\_\_: for anger resteth in the

bosom of \_\_\_\__.”

Proverbs 14:29 “He that is slow to \_\_\_\_ is of great understanding: but he that

is \_\_\_\_\_ of spirit exalteth \_\_\_\_\___.”

NOTE: We, as Christians, should not allow our emotions to control us. There are

some who, by their anger, are a reproach to the faith. Of course there are times, in

the experience of every believer, where negative emotions get the best of us.

During these times we should recognize that fact and come to Jesus, asking for

His forgiving grace to be extended to us. If a believer is continually angry, there

is a much deeper problem that needs to be addressed.

4) Who should we give our anger to?

Proverbs 15:1 “A \_\_\_\_ answer turneth away \_\_\_\__: but grievous words stir

up \_\_\_\__.”

Psalm 37:7,8 “Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself

because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth

wicked devices to pass. Cease from \_\_\_\_\_, and forsake \_\_\_\_\_: fret not thyself

in any wise to do evil.”

NOTE: This is wonderful admonition that God gives to us. “A soft answer turns

away wrath.” This can only be done by the power of God. It is not easy when

someone is angry with you, not be angry with them in return. In fact, it is natural

in our fallen condition to react. But with God all things are possible.

5) What challenging step does God ask us to take?

Ephesians 4:32 “And be ye \_\_\_\_ one to another, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ one

another, even as God for Christ's sake hath \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ you.”

Matthew 6:12 “And \_\_\_\_\_\__ us our debts, \_\_ we \_\_\_\_\_\_ our debtors.”

Colossians 3:13 “Forbearing one another, and \_\_\_\_\_\_ one another, if any

man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ \_\_\_\_\_\__ you, so \_\_\_\_ do ye.”

NOTE: The issue of forgiving each other is a very important one. It is a

salvational issue. If we cannot forgive others, God cannot forgive us. Note the

words of Jesus Himself: “Forgive…as we forgive our debtors.” If we have isolated

pocket of bitterness and resentment in our heart, it has eternal consequences. It

may seem too hard to forgive those who have hurt you and the pain may seem

unbearable. But, when we look at what Jesus went through, it becomes easier to

forgive. As we think back over our own life how time after time we have let the

Master down, and yet He, through it all, has been so good to us. If we take the

time to contemplate on these great themes, forgiving others will become a

privilege to enjoy straight from the hand of Jesus.

6) Who is the hardest person to forgive?

1 John 1:9 “If we \_\_\_\_\_\__ our sins, he is faithful and just to \_\_\_\_\_\_ us our

sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

NOTE: Many times the old cliché that is so often repeated proves to be true: “The

hardest person to forgive is yourself.” You can forgive others, but forgiving

yourself is sometimes more difficult. We must learn to forgive ourselves before

we grow to be a strong, vibrant Christians.

7) How long should it take for us to deal with our anger?

Ephesians 4:26 “Be ye angry, and sin not: \_\_\_ \_\_\__ the sun go down upon

your wrath:” 

NOTE: If we have anger it should be dealt with immediately. The reason for this

is that once anger has been nurtured it is harder to dealt with later. Anger will

turn to resentment and then to bitterness. So, give your anger over to Jesus. Tell

Him all about it. If you have wronged others, ask their forgiveness. Then you

can move on in your Christian experience knowing that you are right with God

and your fellow man.
