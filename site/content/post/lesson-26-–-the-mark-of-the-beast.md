title: Lesson 26 – The Mark of the Beast
date: '2021-02-03T23:41:46+02:00'
---
1) What did God do in the beginning?

Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning God \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the heaven and the earth.”

NOTE: Satan has been very envious of God’s ability to create. It should come as

no surprise that the devil would attack God and His creation.

2) What is God’s Memorial for the creation of this world?

Exodus 20:8-11 “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

But the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ is \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\__ of the LORD thy God: in it thou

shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,

nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in

them is , and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the

Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

NOTE: It is a common practice here on earth that a monument is erected to

memorialize a famous person or event. However, God did not erect a statue or

some other tangible entity, but rather He set aside a whole 24 hour period of time

to remind us of our lofty origin and who our Creator is. Did you know that if the

Sabbath had been kept by human beings since the beginning of time, there would

be no atheists today? You see, the Sabbath day is all about God’s creative act in

the beginning and His overwhelming willingness to create something new in our

hearts in the present.

3) What was the sequence of the creation week?

DAYS 1 & 4: Light / bodies of light

DAYS 2 & 5: Firmament / filling of firmament

DAYS 3 & 6: Earth with food / filling the earth

NOTE: In the first three days of creation God creates the spaces. Days 4-6 He

fills those spaces.

Genesis 1:12 (Day 3) “And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding

seed after his kind, and the tree yielding \_\_\_\_, whose seed was in itself, after

his kind: and God saw that it was \_\_\_\_.”

4) What noble origin does the human race have?

Genesis 1:26 “And God said, Let us make man in \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_, after \_\___

\_\_\_\_\_\__: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the

fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every

creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own

image, in the image of God created he him; \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\___ created he

them.

And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be \_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_, and

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the

sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth

upon the earth.”

NOTE: We are neither descendants of primates nor the result of an ancient cosmic

accident. We have royal blood coursing through our veins because we are sons

and daughters of the King! We were made in the very image of God with the

insatiable desire to be creative and even procreative. This is something that the

devil nor his angels cannot do. For this they are extremely envious and filled with

hate towards us. Not only were we created to fill the vacancy in heaven left by

the fallen angels, but God desired our fellowship and used this earth to

demonstrate His love to the whole universe. This demonstration will secure the

universe from sin throughout eternity. We are the most precious commodity in all

the realms of creation.

 5) What happened next after everything was created?

Genesis 2:1-3 “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the

host of them. And on the \_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ God ended his work which he had

\_\_\_\_\_; and he rested on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ from all his work which he had

made.

And God blessed the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\__ it: because that in it he had

rested from all his work which God created and made.”

NOTE: Here God institutes, blesses and sanctifies the Sabbath. What does it

mean to sanctify? Imagine you have a distinguished guest who visits your home,

and you long to cook a meal for this person. Do you set the table with Styrofoam

plates and cups? Or do you bring out your best glasses and plates for this special

person? Of course, you use the best that you have! You see, the Sabbath is the

best day of the week. In the same way that we set apart special china for special

occasions, the Sabbath has been set apart from the other days of the week as a

special day He wants to spend with us. It is a day of wonderment, a day blessing,

because God has magnified that day above all the others and filled it with

Himself! He desires His people to take part and spend time with Him to build

that love relationship.

 6) Who was the Sabbath made for?

Mark 2:27-28 “And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for \_\_\_\_, and

not \_\_\_\_ for the Sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the

Sabbath.”

NOTE: The Sabbath was not created exclusively for the Jew, but for man. God

had the whole human race in mind when He created the Sabbath day. It is a day

of delight and a day of ceasing from our own secular pursuits. It is a day of resting

in the presence of God, and a day of contemplation on the loveliness of His

Character. This is a time to enjoy God’s creation by going for walks in nature and

learning about the things which He has made. It is the best day of the week, a

weekly, holy holiday!

 7) What is God’s sign to his people?

Exodus 31:13 “Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily

my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a \_\_\_\__ between me and you

throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that

doth \_\_\_\_\_\_ you.”

Ezekiel 20:12 “Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a \_\_\_\__

between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that

\_\_\_\_\_\__ them.”

NOTE: People everywhere are seeking some sign from God. And here it is –

the Sabbath. It is God’s sign to His people that He is in the process of

sanctifying them. It is refreshing to know that we, by our own sheer will

power, cannot make ourselves holy. It is God who is in the business of

making us holy.

In the same way that God set apart the Sabbath in the beginning as holy, He,

in like manner, wants to separate the believers for Himself. But it goes deeper

than just this. In the original language of these verses the definition for the

word for ‘sign’ is ‘a distinguishing mark’. I find that very interesting. So, we

can safely deduct that God’s mark is the Sabbath.

8) Technically speaking, what is a seal?

ANSWER: A seal authenticates a document. A seal always has three parts:

a. Name

b. Title

c. Territory



For example the seal for the present president of the United States gives the

following information:

Name: Abraham Lincoln

Title: President

Territory: The United States of America. 

 In every seal, these three elements must be present.

9) Where did God place his seal?

Deuteronomy 9:10 “And the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone

written with the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of God…”

NOTE: God’s seal is in the heart of God’s law. Notice that this commandment

begins differently than any of the other nine. It asks us to REMEMBER.

Did God, in His foreknowledge, know that humankind would forget? Here

there is something special. “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six

days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath

of the Lord thy God: For in six days the Lord,” There’s the name, Yahweh,

that’s God’s name. “Made heaven and earth,” so that is the title. He is the

Creator. And what is the Territory? “Heaven, earth, the sea, and all that is

in them”.

So here we have all of the answers in one place – in one commandment. The

Lord, that’s His name; we have title, the Creator; and we have the jurisdiction,

which includes everything in heaven and earth. This makes the law authentic

and powerful. Without the Sabbath, without that signature, the whole law

becomes just another document with rules and without any authority.

 10) How is a person to keep the Sabbath holy?

Isaiah 58:13-14 “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing

\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of

the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways,

nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words, then shalt

thought delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the

high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy

father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”

NOTE: God wants us to view the Sabbath not as the Jews of old viewed it, as

a list of restrictions. The commandment itself give us a few principles on how

we should keep it - not doing our own pleasure. He wants us to meet with

Him and have pleasure in Him on the Sabbath day.

 11) Who should keep the Sabbath?

Mark 2:27-28 “And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for \_\_\_\_,

and not man for the Sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of

the Sabbath.”

NOTE: The word ‘man’ in the original language is anatropous, which literally

means humanity. So, the Sabbath was not made for the Jews only, but is a

blessing for all humanity to bask in.

12) Where was the law of God to be placed?

Deuteronomy 11:13-18 “And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken

diligently unto my \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ which I command you this day, to love the

LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your

soul,

That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain

and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and

thine oil.

And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and

be full.

Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn

aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

And then the LORD' wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the

heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and

lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.

Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul,

and bind them for a sign upon your \_\_\_\_\_\_, that they may be as frontlets

between your \_\_\_\_\_\__.”

NOTE: So where must the commandments of God be placed? On your hand

and in your forehead. In the book of Revelation, we also find that the mark

of the beast is to be placed in the hand or in the forehead. Do you think that

God literally intended that they would be placed in the hand or in the

forehead? Do you think that it is a physical mark that can be seen outwardly?

In the Bible, the hand represents our actions (See Ecclesiastes 9:10) The

forehead represents the mind, more specifically it represents where our

decisions are made. So, in essence God is not interested if we merely know

what the ten commandments are, but He wants us to live our lives by our

thoughts and actions in harmony with the ten commandments. This can only

be done through the power of Jesus Christ.

13) What does God greatly desire for His children?

Deuteronomy 5:29 “O that there were such an heart in them, that they

would fear me, and keep \_\_\_\_ my commandments \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, that it might

be well with \_\_\_\__, and with their children for ever!”

NOTE: The reason that God asks us to obey Him is not for His own good, but

for our own good. When He asks us to follow Him He has our best interest in

mind.

14) If the Sabbath is the Seventh day of the week, then why does the Christian

 World keep Sunday?

ANSWER: Schaff-Herza Encyclopedia says, “Sunday (Dies Solis of the

Roman calendar, ‘day of the Sun,’ being dedicated to the sun), the first day of

the week.” Most Oxford dictionaries will say, “Sunday, first day of the week.”

NOTE: So the Sabbath is not Sunday, it’s Saturday. Sunday is the first day of

the week. But the Christian world keeps Sunday.

Daniel 7:25 “And he shall speak great words against the most High, and

shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to \_\_\_\_\_\__ times and

laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the

dividing of time.”

NOTE: Here is the only verse in the Bible that speaks about a change to the

commandments of God. Therefore, it is the only verse that speaks about a

change to the Sabbath.

 But the question we must ask ourselves is this: “Can a man change the ten

commandments?” No. “Therefore, can a man change the Sabbath?” No.

Notice the Bible does not say that a random man changed the Sabbath, but the

power that resides at Rome. The little horn, or the Roman Catholic Church.

Is this possible? We will see for ourselves through their own words.

15) What does Rome say regarding the office of the Pope?

ANSWER: “He can pronounce sentences and judgments in contradictions to

the rights of nations, to the law of God and man. He can free himself from the

commands of the apostles; he, being their superior, and from the rules of the

old testament.”” Decretal, de Translat. Episcop, Cap.

“The Pope has the power to change times, to abrogate laws, and to dispense

with all things, even the precepts of Christ.” Decretal, de Translat. Episcop,

Cap.

“The Pope’s will stand for reason. He can dispense above the law; and of

wrong make right, by correcting and changing laws.” Pope Nicholas, Dist.

96, Quoted in “Facts for the Times.” Pg. 55-56, 1893.

16) What is the Mark of the Beast?

ANSWER: “Sunday is our mark of authority…The Church is above the Bible,

and this transference of Sabbath observance is proof of that fact.” Catholic

Record, September 1, 1923

“Of course the Catholic church claims that the change was her act. The act is a

mark of her ecclesiastical power.” Faith of Our Fathers (Cardinal Gibbons)

“The Bible says remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. The Catholic

church says, No! By my divine power I abolish the Sabbath day and command

you to keep holy the first day of the week. And, lo, the entire civilized world

bows down in reverent obedience to the command of the holy Catholic

Church.” Father Enright, American Sentinel, June 1893

“Sunday is a Catholic institution, and its claims to observance can be

defended only on Catholic principles…From the beginning to the end of

Scripture there is not a single passage which warrants the transfer of weekly

public worship from the last day of the week to the first.” Catholic Press

(Sydney) August 25, 1900

“You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation and you will not find a

single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The scriptures enforce the

religious observance of Saturday.” James Cardinal Gibbons, The Faith of our

Fathers, p. 89.

“The Christian Sabbath is, therefore, to this day the acknowledged offspring

of the Catholic church, as spouse of the Holy Ghost, without a word of

remonstrance from the protestant world.” The Catholic Mirror September 23,

1893.

“If Protestants would follow the Bible, they should worship God on the

Sabbath Day. In keeping the Sunday they are following a law of the Catholic

Church.” Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Baltimore replying in a letter dated

February 10, 1920

“Protestantism, in discarding the authority of the Roman Church, has no good

reasons for its Sunday theory, and ought logically to keep Saturday as the

Sabbath.” John Gilmary Shea, American Catholic Quarterly Review, January

1883

“Reason and common sense demand the acceptance of One, or the other of

these alternatives: either Protestantism and the keeping holy of Saturday, or

Catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday. Compromise is impossible.” The

Catholic Mirror, December 23, 1893.

NOTE: There’s the battle line. If you obey God, you keep which day?

Saturday. If you obey the Catholic Church, you keep Sunday. That’s what

they say. If you’re a Protestant and you’re keeping Sunday, you’re really

obeying whom? You’re obeying the Pope. That doesn’t mean that Protestants

out there who have never heard this information now have the mark of the

beast, they don’t. Because God is judging them according to the light that they

have. But this issue is going to become very prominent, very soon.

17) What do Protestant denominations say about this subject?

EPISCOPAL CHURCH: “Is there any command in the New Testament to

change the day of weekly rest from Saturday to Sunday? None.” Manual of

Christian Doctrine P. 127.

“We have made a change from the seventh day to the first day, from Saturday

to Sunday, on the authority of the one holy Catholic and apostolic church of

Christ.” Why we keep Sunday. P. 28.

LUTHERAN CHURCH: “The observance of the Lord’s day (Sunday) is

founded not on any command of God, but on the authority of the church.”

Augsburg Confession, Catholic Sabbath Manual, part 2, section 10.

PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH: “A change of the day to be observed from the

last day of the week to the first. There is no record, no express command,

authorizing this change.” The Christian Sabbath by N.L. Rice.

METHODIST CHRUCH: “Take the matter of Sunday… there is no passage

telling Christians to keep that day, or to transfer the Jewish Sabbath to that

day.” Christian Advocate, July 2, 1942.

CONGREGATIONALIST CHURCH: “It’s quite clear that however rigidly or

devoutly we spend Sunday, we are not keeping the Sabbath… There is not a

single sentence in the New Testament to suggest that we incur any penalty by

violating the supposed sanctity of Sunday.” The Ten Commandments by Dr.

Dale.

ANGLICAN CHURCH: “Many people think that Sunday is the Sabbath, but

neither in the New Testament nor in the early church, is there anything to

suggest that we have any right to transfer the observance of the seventh day of

the week to the first. The Sabbath was and is Saturday and not Sunday … “

Rev. Lionel Beere, Church of the People.

BAPTIST CHURCH: “There was and is a commandment to keep holy the

Sabbath day, but that Sabbath day was not Sunday… There is no scriptural

evidence of the change of the Sabbath institution from the seventh day to the

first day of the week.” Hiscox, The Baptist Manual

18) What is Sunday founded on?

ANSWER: “Sunday is founded not on Scripture, but on tradition, and is a

distinctly Catholic institution.” Catholic Record, September 17, 1893

“The New Testament makes no explicit mention that the apostles changed the

day of worship, but we know it from tradition.” The New Revised Baltimore

Catechism, (1949), pg. 139

NOTE: Sunday Worship is solely based on tradition, and not on one line of

Scripture.

19) What does Jesus think about tradition?

Matthew 15:3,6,9 “But He answered and said to them, why do you also

transgress the commandment of God by your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__?... And you

voided the commandment of God by your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_… But in \_\_\_\__

they worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of \_\_\_\_.”

NOTE: There is nothing wrong with tradition, as long as the tradition is in

harmony with God’s Word. But, if it isn’t, then we worship God in vain,

according to Jesus Himself.

 IS IT YOUR DESIRE…

 I understand that this issue is bigger than a day, but it strikes at the very root

of God’s authority. Do we follow the teachings of men, or do we take our

stand with Jesus and His Sabbath. Do you choose to honor God by keeping

His Sabbath holy? Do you take God’s Mark instead of the Mark of the Beast?

Yes or No
