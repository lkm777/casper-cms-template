1) What is faith based upon?

Hebrews 11:1 “Now \_\_\_\_ is the substance of things hoped for, the \_\_\_\____ of

things not seen.”

NOTE: Faith is based on evidence and not on emotion. If it is based on emotion it

is weak.

2) What amazing things does Jesus promise to us if we have faith?

Mark 11:22-24 “And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, Be

thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not \_\_\_\_\_\_ in his

heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he

shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever

ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have

them.”

NOTE: Jesus promises that, as we exercise faith, the mountains of difficulty in

our lives will ultimately be surmounted. It may not be immediate, but that

promise is sure if we hold on by the grace of God.

3) What must we have if we want to please God?

Hebrews 11:6 “But \_\_\_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\_ it is impossible to please him: for he that

cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of them that

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ seek him.”

NOTE: Faith is an absolute essential for the Christian life. It is, in fact, impossible

the please God without having it.

4) What has God given to every person who has ever been born?

Romans 12:3 “For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that

is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but

to think soberly, according as God hath \_\_\_\__ to every man the measure of

\_\_\_\_\_\__.”

NOTE: God has given to each one a measure of faith. The measure we are given

we are to improve upon.

5) What is the best way to increase your faith?

Romans 10:17 “So then \_\_\_\_ cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of

God.”

NOTE: Faith grows as we spend time in the Word of God. If our faith is failing

in our life perhaps it is because we have neglected time in the Scriptures. Many

times people will begin their Christian experience with a great love for the

Scriptures. When the novelty wears off, studying the Bible isn’t relished like it

once was. Eventually all desire for spiritual things die out. Because of this, we

should always make it a habit of studying the Word, even when we don’t “feel”

like it.

6) How can we truly benefit from reading the Scriptures?

Hebrews 4:2 “For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but

the word preached \_\_\_ \_\_\_ profit them, not being \_\_\_\_\_ with \_\_\_\_\_ in them

that heard it.”

NOTE: Is it possible for a person to read the Bible and yet not benefit? It is

possible. When we approach God’s Word we must have faith to believe that

what is written is true and comes from the Father above.

7) What should we expect from God when we study His Word?

2 Peter 1:3,4 “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things

that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath

called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\__

and precious \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine

nature, having \_\_\_\_\_\_ the corruption that is in the world through lust.”

8) What does it mean to live by faith?

Romans 1:16-17 “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the

power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and

also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith

to faith: as it is written, The just shall \_\_\_\_ by faith.”

NOTE: Living by faith is living according to every Word that God has said. It is

not living by feelings or emotions. Living by faith is living by steadfast, Biblical

Principles and in perpetual surrender to Jesus Christ. Living by faith is to live in

constant communion with Jesus Christ. This is truly living!

9) What is another practical way we can help our faith grow?

Hebrews 12:1-2 “Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so

great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which

doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before

us, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ unto \_\_\_\__ the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy

that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set

down at the right hand of the throne of God.”

NOTE: We should look to Jesus. This phrase “looking to Jesus,” is often used in

Christian circle as a cliché. What does it mean to look to Jesus? When you “look

to” someone in our day it denotes respect or being willing to be led by that

person, a willingness to listen to what that person has to say and an expectancy to

do what is suggested. This is exactly what it means to “look to Jesus.”

10) What will faith always want?

Matthew 26:39 “And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,

saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless

not as \_\_ will, but as \_\___ wilt.”

NOTE: True faith will always want what God wants. Faith does not stop to

measure what I feel like, or to consider situational ethics. Faith is doing what God

says do, with feelings or without feelings.

11) What can we have the highest confidence in?

1 John 5:14 “And this is the confidence that we have in \_\_\_\_, that, if we ask

any thing according to his will, he heareth us:”

 NOTE: The life of the Christian is one of continual faith and trust in Our

Father in Heaven. It is to know that whatever happens to us in our life journey

that God is in control, and has our ultimate best in mind. Sometimes it may not

look like that is the case. This is why it is imperative for us to learn how to

cultivate our faith before the trials come our way.
