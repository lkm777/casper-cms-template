1. What does our God invite us to do?

**Luke 11:13 “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your**

**children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to**

**them that ___ him?**

**Psalm 65:2 “O thou that \_\_\_\_\_\__ prayer, unto thee shall \_\_\_ \_\_\___ come.”**

**Mark 11:23-24 “For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this**

**mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not**

**doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall**

**come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you,**

**What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and**

**ye shall have them.”**

**NOTE**: We are invited to seek God in prayer, believing that He will hear and

answer our petition according to our best good.

2. Before we seek the Lord in prayer, what should we make sure of first?

**1 John 5:14,15 “And this is the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ that we have in him, that, if we ask**

**any thing according to his \_\_\_\_, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear**

**us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of**

**him.”**

**Matthew 26:39 “And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,**

**saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless**

**not as I \_\_\_, but as thou \_\_\_.”**

**NOTE**: We need to make sure that we are praying according to God’s will, and

not our own will. Just as Jesus prayed, we are to pray.

3. What should we bring before our God?

**1 Peter 5:7 “Casting all your \_\_\_\_\_\_ upon him; for he careth for you.”**

**Psalm 55:22 “Cast thy \_\_\_\_\_\_ upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he**

**shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.”**

**NOTE**: We are to bring before God everything that troubles us. We are to tell

Him everything that makes us mad, sad, glad and bad. He wants us desperately to

be open with Him. Why do we as humans try to hide from Him anyway? He sees

everything we say and do, and He even knows our very thoughts that no one else

knows. So, why not pour out your heart to Him? Tell him everything, just like

you would tell your best friend everything here on this earth. You see, it is the

devil’s strategy in telling us, “God will not listen to you.” “He doesn’t love you.”

These are the same lies that he is telling to virtually every man, woman, and child

to keep them from the greatest source of power in the entire universe – the throne

of God.

4. What should we always mingle with our prayers to God?

**Philippians 1:4 “Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request**

**with ___,”**

**Colossians 3:15-17 “And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the**

**which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of**

**Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one**

**another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your**

**hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name**

**of the Lord Jesus, \_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_ to God and the Father by him.”**

**1 Thessalonians 5:18 “In every thing \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\____: for this is the will of God**

**in Christ Jesus concerning you.”**

**NOTE**: When we pray, we are to have joy in our hearts, because we are

communicating with the One who created us and redeemed us by His own blood.

We are communicating with the One who is in total control of what is happening

on planet earth. Even though many times it looks as if the world is hurled into

total chaos, God is within the shadows keeping watch of His own. We are also to

praise God and thank Him in our prayers. When we praise God we begin to see

that He is much bigger than our worst of problems. We begin to see things as

they really are. We realize that our self-pity is worthless at the foot of the cross.

God is on our side, and nothing is too big for Him to handle and to take care of. I

am so happy that the God of the Bible is on our side, and wants us to be with Him

even more than we do.

5. What is the ultimate purpose of prayer?

**Revelation 3:20 “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my**

**voice, and \_\_\_\_ the \_\_\_\_, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he**

**with me.”**

**Ephesians 3:16-19 “That he would grant you, according to the riches of his**

**glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; That**

**Christ may \_\_\_\_\_ in your \_\_\_\_\__ by \_\_\_\__; that ye, being rooted and**

**grounded in love, May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the**

**breadth, and length, and depth, and height; And to know the love of Christ,**

**which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.”**

**NOTE**: The ultimate purpose of prayer is for Christ to dwell in your heart by

faith. Prayer is the closest we can come to God on this earth. Prayer is the breath

of the soul.

6. When should we especially seek the Lord in prayer?

**Mark 1:35 “And in the \_\_\_\_\_\__, rising up a \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\__ before day, he went**

**out, and departed into a \_\_\_\_\_\_ place, and there prayed.”**

**Jeremiah 29:13 “And ye shall \_\_\_\_ me, and \_\_\_\_ me , when ye shall search**

**for me with ___ your heart.”**

**NOTE**: The best example we have in the Bible is the example set forth by Jesus

Christ. The Bible says that Jesus went to pray in the morning a great while before

day. It also says that He went to a solitary place. We will touch on that later. In

Jeremiah, we read that we will find God when we search for Him with our whole

heart. The morning is the best time for this because our minds have not been

deluded with the care of the current day. We can hear God’s voice more

distinctly in the quiet moments of the early morning. Many times, also, God will

give us just what we need for that day in the morning.

7. How should we pray to God?

**Luke 11:1 “And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place,**

**when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, \_\_\_\_ __ to pray, as**

**John also taught his disciples.”**

**NOTE**: This should be the prayer of our heart as well. “Lord, teach us to pray.”

It must have been something to hear Jesus pray. After the disciples heard Jesus

pray, they said, “Lord, teach us to pray.” These were men that were spiritual, and

yet when they heard Jesus pray, they realized that they couldn’t pray as well as

they thought they could. May we, by the grace of God, pray like Jesus.

8. What is a good habit to develop?

**Deuteronomy 8:2 “And thou shalt \_\_\_\_\_\__ all the way which the LORD thy**

**God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove**

**thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his**

**commandments, or no.”**

**1 Chronicles 16:12 “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ his marvellous works that he hath done, his**

**wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;”**

**NOTE**: God knows that the human family is prone to forget. That is why He

admonishes us so many times in the Scriptures to remember. We are to remember

His marvelous works, remember how He has led us in the past, remember how

much He loves us, remember how much He wants us to be saved and remember

how He has answered our prayers. In the life of every Christian, inevitably, there

are times of darkness, times in which it seems that God is no longer there and

times that seem hopeless. It is at that very time that we are to remember how God

has been with us.
