1. Who are Christians ambassadors for?

**2 Corinthians 5:20 “Now then we are ambassadors for \_\_\_\_\_\_, as though**

**God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to**

**God.”**

**NOTE**: We are ambassadors for Jesus Christ. There is an old cliché that goes

like this, “You may be the only Jesus people ever see.” There is definitely some

truth to that statement. We are to represent Jesus to a world that does not know

who He is.

2. What must be lifted up before the people?

**Isaiah 62:10 “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the**

**people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; \_\_\_\_ up a**

**\_\_\_\_\_\__ for the people.”**

**NOTE**: Standards are not popular to talk about these days. Many feel that

standards are legalistic requirements. But, can you imagine an earthly army

without any kind of standards? Surely that army would not be organized or

equipped for their warfare. In many instances Christian standards serve the same

function. It let’s everyone know around you whose side you are on in the battle

between good and evil.

3. What does God tell us not to love?

**1 John 2:15-17 “Love not the \_\_\_\_\_, neither the things that are in the \_\_\_\_\_.**

**If any man love the \_\_\_\_\_\_, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is**

**in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of**

**life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and**

**the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”**

**NOTE**: We are commanded to not love the world and all its charms. The word,

“world” in this context is not speaking about the people in the world, but rather

the things of this world and the attitudes that are so prevalent in our secular

society. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, these three

characteristics have saturated our way of life for so long that they are deemed as

totally acceptable. Whether it is some partially nude person on a billboard, or if it

is simply the mindset of pride in the business world, these things God hates, and

He wants His followers to hate these things as well.

4. What are we not to be conformed by?

**Romans 12:1-2 “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,**

**that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,**

**which is your reasonable service. And be not \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ to this \_\_\_\__: but be**

**ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that**

**good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”**

**NOTE**: Christians should not just go with the flow of society. If they are, maybe

they are not true believers. We should not conform to what the world does in

order to fit in with the world. A perfect example: in a small suburb of Los

Angeles a young man named McKay Hatch, founded an unprecedented club –

“The No Cussing Club.” Hatch said, “I finally told my friends, I don't cuss. And

I said, If you want to hang out with me, you don't cuss.” This club even has their

own website. Hatch is definitely not conformed to this world in that aspect at

least.

5. What should Christians think about?

**Philippians 4:8 “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are ___, whatsoever**

**things are \_\_\_\_\_\_, whatsoever things are \_\_\_\_, whatsoever things are \_\_\_\_,**

**whatsoever things are \_\_\_\_\_\_, whatsoever things are of good report; if there**

**be any \_\_\_\_\_, and if there be any \_\_\_\_\_, think on these things.”**

**NOTE**: As Christians we are to think about the things mentioned above. This

should be our standard of what we view on television and how we talk to one

another.

6. How can we change our natural character?

**2 Corinthians 3:18 “But we all, with open face \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ as in a glass the**

**glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even**

**as by the Spirit of the Lord.”**

**NOTE**: To change is to behold. When we spend time with God in His word and

look to Him, we will see the changes as we become more like Him. Some

changes may be dramatic, some may take years, but the pivotal issue is that we

keep beholding.

7. How does God feel about those who love violence?

**Psalm 11:5 “The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that**

**loveth violence his soul \_\_\_\_\_\__.”**

**NOTE**: God does not take kindly to those who are bloodthirsty. He hates their

activities so much that if they choose not to repent, He will destroy them.

8. What should be the prayer of our heart?

**Psalm 119:37 “Turn away mine eyes from beholding \_\_\_\_\_\_; and quicken**

**thou me in thy way.”**

**NOTE**: In our culture of vanity this is a prayer that is especially applicable.

9. What is the goal of the Christian life?

**Philippians 2:5 “Let this mind be in \_\_\_, which was also in \_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\___:**

**Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:**

**But made himself of \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__, and took upon him the form of a**

**servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as**

**a man, he \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ himself, and became \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ unto death, even the**

**death of the cross.”**

**NOTE**: The goal of the Christian life is not to go to heaven. The goal of the

Christian life is to be like Jesus. When we see the humility in the life of Jesus, it

is a direct rebuke to proud human beings like ourselves. Much of the fashions and

customs in our world today are designed to appeal to our pride. Jesus is calling us

to behold Him and to observe how He is. This is why the Christian cannot love

the world. If a Christian loves the world then they are a Christian in name only

regardless of their profession.

10. How should a Christian dress?

**1 Timothy 2:9-10 “In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ hair,**

**or \_\_\_\_, or \_\_\_\__, or costly array; But (which becometh women professing**

**godliness) with good works.”**

**1 Peter 3:2-4 “While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.**

**Whose adorning let it not be that \_\_\_\_\_\_ adorning of plaiting the hair, and of**

**wearing of \_\_\_\_, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of**

**the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and**

**quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.”**

**NOTE**: When it comes to Christian dress, modesty is the best policy. That is the

all-pervading principle. God wants us to focus on our walk with Him, not to rush

to the mall when every new fashion is unveiled. It does not mean we should dress

slovenly but be neat and clean.

It also grieves the Lord when His children wear jewelry. Jewelry attracts

attention to the wearer, and basically preaches the sermon – “I am not satisfied

with the way that God has made me.” What does the Bible mean when it says the

plaiting of the hair? The plaiting of the hair was the practice of weaving gold into

the hair. So, it is not speaking of braiding the hair like it is done today.

11. What did God command Jacob to do?

**Genesis 35:2-4 “Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with**

**him, Put away the \_\_\_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\__ that are among you, and be clean, and**

**change your \_\_\_\_\_\__: And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make**

**there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was**

**with me in the way which I went. And they gave unto Jacob all the \_\_\_\_\_\__**

**\_\_\_\__ which were in their \_\_\_\_, and all their \_\_\_\_\_\_ which were in their \_\___;**

**and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.”**

**NOTE**: When Jacob had a revival experience with God, he was told to change his

garments and to remove the strange gods in his hand and the earrings in his

family’s ears. This is very significant. Today, we are living in the time of

judgment, and because of this we should realize that we, too ,should prepare our

lives for the coming of Jesus.

12. What did the children of Israel do as they entered the Promised Land?

**Exodus 33:3-6 “Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up**

**in the midst of thee; for thou art a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ people: lest I consume thee in**

**the way. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no**

**man did put on him his \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__. For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say**

**unto the children of Israel, Ye are a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ people: I will come up into**

**the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. And the**

**children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount**

**Horeb.”**

**NOTE**: What does God call a person who wears jewelry stubbornly? He calls

them stiff necked. God called them to strip themselves of their jewelry before

they entered the Promised Land. He is doing exactly the same thing today. He is

calling people to remove their ornaments before they enter the Heavenly

Promised Land.

13. In the Bible, what is jewelry associated with?

**Hosea 2:13 “And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned**

**incense to them, and she \_\_\_\_\_\_ herself with her \_\_\_\_\_\_ and her \_\_\_\_\_\_, and**

**she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.”**

**NOTE**: Like it or not, jewelry is associated with idolatry. It is associated with

forgetting about the God of heaven.

14. How does God picture the false church at the end of time?

**Revelation 17:1-5 “And there came one of the seven angels which had the**

**seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew**

**unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:**

**With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the**

**inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her**

**fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I**

**saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy,**

**having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple**

**and scarlet colour, and decked with \_\_\_\_ and precious \_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_,**

**having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her**

**fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY,**

**BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND**

**ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”**

**NOTE**: When God pictures the rebellious religious system at the end of time, He

uses a woman that is decked out in gold, precious stones, and pearls.

15. What does Jesus want to clothe us with?

**Isaiah 61:1-3 “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD**

**hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to**

**bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the**

**opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable**

**year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that**

**mourn; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty**

**for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\_\__ for the spirit**

**of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of**

**the LORD, that he might be glorified.”**

**NOTE**: Jesus wants to cover us with His righteousness. Then we will wear the

garment of praise for what He has done for us.

16. What should our relationship with God be like?

**John 8:29 “And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me**

**alone; for I do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ those things that \_\_\_\_\_\_ him.”**

**NOTE**: Wow! What a testimony Jesus had! He always did those things that

pleased the Father. Jesus wants us to be the same - always finding out what best

pleases the Lord. That is life at its best.

17. Where does true happiness come from?

**John 13:17 “If ye \_\_\_\_\_\_ these things, \_\_\_\_\_\_ are ye if ye do them.”**

**NOTE**: Once we know what God’s will is, we are happy when we please Him.

Everything else that we do to find happiness will not produce happiness.

18. What should be the Christian’s ultimate delight?

**Psalm 40:8 “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my**

**heart.”**

**NOTE**: A real Christian delights in following God. To please Him in every

lifestyle practice. Some may say, that the concept of what we wear is a “little

thing” and that God doesn’t care about “such things.” Friends, if we are being

true with ourselves we will recognize that this is not the case. If it is such a “little

thing” it will not be a problem giving up these little things for Jesus.

**IS IT YOUR DESIRE…**

To follow Jesus, by always doing those things that please Him. **Yes or No**
