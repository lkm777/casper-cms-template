1) How can we be sure that Jesus will come again?

John 14:1-3 “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my

Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. \_\_ \_\_ to

prepare a place for you. And if \_\_ \_\_ and prepare a place for you, \_\_ \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_,

and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”

NOTE: Jesus has promised most emphatically: “I am coming again.” We have His word that

this will be so.

 2) What did the angels tell the onlookers when Jesus ascended to heaven?

Acts 1:9-11 “And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up;

and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward

heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; Which also said,

Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this \_\_\_\__ Jesus, which is taken

up from you into heaven, shall so come in \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\____ as ye have seen him go into

heaven.”

NOTE: The angels told the onlookers that the same Jesus that they saw ascend into heaven will

come in the same way that they saw Him go into heaven. In other words, the second coming

will not be some mystical event, but it will be real, physical and tangible. It will not be

imaginary as if it were some sort of mirage. It will be a literal event.

 3) What will happen to those that have died at this time?

1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,

with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall

\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\___: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with

them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”

NOTE: The Bible is clear that the dead in Christ will rise first. So, if the dead in Christ rise

first, who rises next?

 4) Who takes part in the second resurrection?

John 5:28-29 “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the

graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the

resurrection of life; and \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_, unto the resurrection of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__.”

NOTE: The Bible speaks of two resurrections. The first is reserved for the righteous – those

who have given their life to Jesus Christ. The second resurrection is reserved for the wicked or

unrighteous – those who have refused to submit to the drawing power of Jesus Christ.

 5) What happens to the wicked when Jesus comes the second time?

2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 “And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus

shall be \_\_\_\_\_\__ from heaven with his \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_, In flaming fire taking vengeance on

them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who

shall be punished with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from the presence of the Lord, and from the

glory of his power;”

2 Thessalonians 2:8 “And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall

consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ with the brightness of his \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:”

NOTE: When Jesus comes the second time the righteous meet Him in the air. The wicked, the

Bible says, will be slain by the brightness of His coming.

 6) What happens to Satan when Jesus comes?

Revelation 20:1-2 “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the

bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old

serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and \_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\_ a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\___,”

NOTE: There are two items we should especially take heed to in these verses. The first item we

need to look at is the phrase: “bottomless pit.” This is the only time in the Bible that this phrase

is used. However, in the Greek language the word is “Abussos.” What does that mean? In the

Greek Old Testament (Septuagint) the word “Abussos” is found in Genesis 1:2, and it literally

means, “without form and void.” Therefore, the condition of the earth at this time is similar to

the time before the creation of the earth. So Satan is somewhere that is desolate, somewhere

that has no life whatsoever. Where is that? We will come to that a little bit later in this study.

The second item we need to address is the issue of the “great chain.” What kind of chain is

this? Is it a literal chain, or is it a symbolic chain?

 7) What kind of chain is Satan bound with?

2 Peter 2:4 “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell (Gr:

grave), and delivered them into \_\_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\_\__, to be reserved unto judgment;”

NOTE: Satan cannot be bound by a literal chain, because Satan is a spiritual being. Therefore

the chain must be, by definition, a symbolic chain or a chain of circumstances if you will. What

is that chain of circumstances that he is bound by? At this time there is no one left on the earth

to tempt. The wicked have been destroyed by the coming of Jesus, while the righteous are with

Him. Satan is left to ponder the results of his rebellion and sees the absolute desolation that he

has caused on this earth.

 8) Does the Bible describe what the earth looks like at this time?

Jeremiah 4:23-27 “I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\__; and the

heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the

hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens

were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the \_\_\_\__ thereof

were \_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\__ at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. For thus hath

the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.”

Jeremiah 25:33 “And the \_\_\_\_ of the LORD shall be at \_\_\_ \_\_\_ from one end of the earth

even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, neither \_\_\_\_\_\_\__, nor

\_\_\_\_\_\__; they shall be dung upon the ground.”

NOTE: The earth at this time is broken down because of the coming of Jesus. The dead cannot

be buried, because there is no one left to bury them. When Jesus comes the righteous meet Him

in the air, and the wicked are destroyed because they cannot see Jesus and live. (See Hebrews

12:14,29)

 9) What will the righteous be doing for 1,000 years?

Revelation 20:4 “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and \_\_\_\_\_\__ was given unto

them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the

word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had

received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\__

with Christ a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\__.”

1 Corinthians 6:2 “Do ye not know that the \_\_\_\__ shall judge the world? and if the world

shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?”

NOTE: The righteous are pictured judging . What kind of judgment is this? It is the judgment

of verification. The righteous are verifying the judgment of God. The righteous will see that

God gave everyone on planet earth the opportunity to be saved and it was their choice to be lost.

Why? Because God is so good that He wants everyone who is saved to be absolutely sure that

He can be trusted throughout eternity.

 10) When does the second resurrection take place?

Revelation 20:5 “But the \_\_\_\_ of the \_\_\_\_ lived not again until the thousand years were

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_…”

NOTE: At the end of the 1,000 year period, when the righteous have reigned with Christ and

conducted the judgment of verification, Christ , along with the righteous, return to earth in the

holy city. (Rev. 21: 2) Then the wicked are resurrected. With this resurrection, immortality

will not be given as at the first resurrection. They will have bodies that are subject to death and

now await to receive their final reward.

 11) What will Satan be doing at this time?

Revelation 20:7 “And when the \_\_\_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\_\_\_ are \_\_\_\_\_\__, \_\_\_\_\_\_ shall be \_\_\_\_\_\__ out

of his \_\_\_\_\_\__,”

NOTE: Satan is loosed out of his prison. How is he loosed? He now has people alive on the

earth to tempt. The wicked are resurrected and they will once again be subject to his

temptations. He will lead them into one final act of rebellion against the one who created them

and died for them. 

 12) What will Satan lead these people to do?

Revelation 20:9 “And they went up on the \_\_\_\_\_\__ of the \_\_\_\_\_\_, and compassed the

camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and \_\_\_\__ came down from God out of

heaven, and devoured them.”

NOTE: As Satan leads this all out attack on God and His people, God will mercifully bring

their rebellion to an end. They fought against God during their lifetime, refusing to submit to

His love. After they are resurrected they will not change their minds. All of humanity will be

involved in this last great conflict. There will be only two classes – those inside the city of

God, and those fighting against God outside the city. Sadly, most will be fighting against God.

But, in love, God destroys them all, (Mal. 4:1) because He knows that it would be torture for

them to live inside the holy city.

 13) What will happen after the wicked are destroyed?

Revelation 21:1-3 “And I saw a \_\_\_ heaven and a \_\_\_ earth: for the first heaven and the

first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city,

new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for

her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of

God is \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God

himself shall be with them, and be their God.”

NOTE: After the wicked are destroyed, God is going to recreate the world once again to its

original beauty. In addition to this, God will tabernacle with us on this earth and, in His great

unexplainable love, bring the capitol of the universe to this planet.(See Rev. 21: 3, 4)

IS IT YOUR DESIRE…

To surrender your life into the hands of Jesus Christ and be a part of the group that will inhabit

the holy city and the new earth? Yes or No
