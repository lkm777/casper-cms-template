1. What is the great commission given by Jesus to those who follow Him?

**Matthew 28:18-20 “And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power**

**is given unto me in heaven and in earth.**

**Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\__ in the name of the**

**Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:**

**Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and,**

**lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”**

**NOTE**: Every Christian is commissioned to lead others to a knowledge of Jesus

and to be baptized. This was evidently very important to Jesus because it was one

of the last things He said while He walked on this earth.

2. Is baptism an issue of salvation?

**Mark 16:16 “He that believeth and is \_\_\_\_\_\__ shall be saved; but he that**

**believeth not shall be damned.”**

**John 3:5 “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be**

**born of \_\_\_\_\_ and of the Spirit, he cannot \_\_\_\_\_ into the kingdom of God.”**

**NOTE**: Yes, baptism is an issue of salvation. Baptism can be compared to a

marriage. It is a public ceremony expressing one’s love and commitment to Jesus

Christ. There are no “magical properties” within the water itself. It is a ceremony

that proclaims the change that has happened within the heart of the candidate

when he has accepted Jesus as his Lord and Savior.

3. According to the Bible, how many kinds of baptism are there?

**Ephesians 4:5 “One Lord, one faith, one \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,”**

**NOTE**: Today in the Christian world, there are many, many kinds of baptism.

But the Bible describes only one baptism. What is that one baptism?

4. What Jesus an infant when He was baptized?

**Matthew 3:13-17 “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to**

**be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized**

**of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it**

**to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he**

**suffered him. And \_\_\_\_\_, when he was \_\_\_\_\____, went up straightway out of**

**the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit**

**of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from**

**heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”**

**NOTE**: Jesus was not an infant, but He was an adult when He was baptized.

Infant baptism is not a biblical teaching, but rather it was a man made creed.

Consider the following statement about this issue…

The following curse was pronounced on Roman Catholic church defectors: "May

the Son who suffered for us curse him! May the Holy Spirit who suffered for us

in baptism curse him!" "Let him be accursed who says adults must be baptized."

(History of Romanism, P.510)

So, I guess, according to this train of logic, John the Baptist and Jesus are

accursed!!! Sadly, this seems to be yet another unbiblical teaching coming from

the Roman Church.

5. How much water does it take to be baptized?

**John 3:23 “And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because**

**there was \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\__: and they came, and were baptized.”**

**NOTE**: Evidently, having a lot of water around is very crucial when a person is

baptized. If not, John would not have needed to be in a place where there was

much water. This fact brings to mind a mode of baptism that is practiced freely

today; baptism by sprinkling or infusion, as it is sometimes called. Please

consider with me the following statements regarding this topic…

"For several centuries after the establishment of Christianity, baptism was

conferred by immersion, but since the twelfth century the practice of baptizing by

infusion has prevailed in the Catholic church, as this manner is attended with less

inconvenience than baptism by immersion." (James Cardinal Gibbons, The faith

of our Fathers, 110th. ed. p.277)

6. What then is the proper way of Baptism?

**Mark 1:9-10 “And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from**

**Nazareth of Galilee, and was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ of John in Jordan. And straightway**

**coming \_\_ \_\____ of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like**

**a dove descending upon him:”**

**Acts 8:38 “And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went \_\_\_\_**

**\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.”**

**Colossians 2:12 “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen**

**with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him**

**from the dead.”**

**NOTE**: The word “baptize” is derived from the Greek word, “baptizo” which

means to immerse, submerge or plunge underneath. Therefore, the biblical

baptism is baptism by immersion. Sprinkling is not biblical and is not a proper

baptism.

7. What does baptism by immersion symbolize?

**Romans 6:3-6 “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus**

**Christ were baptized into his \_\_\_\_\_? Therefore we are \_\_\_\_\__ \_\_\_ \_\_\__ by**

**baptism into death: that like as Christ was \_\_\_\_\_\_ ___ from the dead by the**

**glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in \_\_\_\_\_\__ of life. For if we**

**have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the**

**likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with**

**him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not**

**serve sin.”**

**NOTE**: The symbolic meaning of baptism is of the utmost significance. That is

the reason why other modes of baptism cannot be a substitute for it. It represents

the death of the old life of sin and a resurrection to a new life free from sin, its

guilt and condemnation. This is a wonderful experience for all those that make

this public declaration of their allegiance to Jesus Christ. It is the greatest joy to

have all of your sins removed from you!

8. What must precede baptism?

**Acts 2:38 “Then Peter said unto them, \_\_\_\_\_\__, and be baptized every one of**

**you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive**

**the gift of the Holy Ghost.”**

**NOTE**: Before a person is baptized they should recognize that their sins put Jesus

on the cross. They should realize that they are a sinner, and should have a sorrow

for sin that is deep enough for them to turn away from sin. The good news is that

repentance is a gift. (See Acts 5:31)

9. How do those who want to be baptized react when they hear God’s Word?

**Acts 2:41 “Then they that \_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\__ his word were baptized: and the**

**same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.”**

**NOTE**: Those who want to be baptized are eager to follow what God says in His

Word. They will not make excuses, but they will find out what best pleases the

Lord.

10. If I am baptized, do I have to join a church?

**1 Corinthians 12:13 “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into \_\_\_ \_\_\__,**

**whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been**

**all made to drink into one Spirit.”**

**NOTE**: The question, “Do I have to join the church?” is an interesting one.

If you are baptized why wouldn’t you want to join the church? We are not

baptized as independent atoms. God wants us to have fellowship one with

another. It is like a race car driver that doesn’t want to go to the racetrack. A true,

born again, believer will want to join the church.

11. What is one oftentimes neglected prerequisite for baptism?

**Matthew 28:18-20 “And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power**

**is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and \_\_\_\_ all**

**nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the**

**Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have**

**commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the**

**world. Amen.”**

**NOTE**: Something that many ministers forget today is to teach. Teach whom?

Teach the potential candidates before baptism. Many churches in the world

today, will baptize anyone that comes down to the altar when an appeal is made.

It is wonderful that people respond to the prompting of the Holy Spirit, but this

should not be when a person is baptized. A person needs to be taught the basic

principles of Christianity so that they can make an informed decision about

baptism.

12. How should you respond to God when He is calling you to be baptized?

**Acts 22:16 “And now why \_\_\_\_\_\__ thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash**

**away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.”**

**NOTE**: In most cases waiting to make a decision is wise. But, in spiritual matters

that pertain to eternal life, delay is dangerous.

**IS IT YOUR DESIRE…**

Do you want to have a new start, to experience a new life? Do you want to make

special preparations for baptism?** Yes or No**
