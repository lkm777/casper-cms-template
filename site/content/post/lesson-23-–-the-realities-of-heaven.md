1) Is Heaven just a concept?

John 14:1-3 “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also

in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would

have told you. I go to prepare a \_\_\_\_\_\_ for you. And if I go and prepare a

\_\_\_\_\_\_ for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I

am, there ye may be also.”

NOTE: Jesus said that He is preparing a place for you. So, heaven cannot be a

state of mind as many would suggest. Heaven is a literal place.

2) What did the Lord promise to do with this earth?

2 Peter 3:10-13 “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in

the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements

shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein

shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what

manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,

Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the

heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with

fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for \_\_\_ \_\_\____

and a \_\_\_ \_\_\___, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”

NOTE: God promised to make a new heavens and a new earth where

righteousness dwells. The only reason that righteousness will dwell on the earth,

is because that is where God will dwell.

3) Who will inherit the new earth?

Matthew 5:5 “Blessed are the \_\_\_\_: for they shall inherit the earth.”

NOTE: What does it mean to be meek? Does it mean weak? No, not at all. The

word “meek” means submissive or humble. The people that will be on the new

earth will not be proud people. They will be willing to submit to God’s leading.

4) Where will the holy city come from?

Revelation 21:1-5 “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first

heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of

God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people,

and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.

And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no

more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain:

for the former things are passed away.

And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he

said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.”

NOTE: The holy city will come down from God out of heaven.

5) Why did God create the earth in the first place?

Isaiah 45:18 “For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God

himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created

it not in vain, he formed it to be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__: I am the LORD; and there is

none else.”

NOTE: God created this world to be inhabited.

6) What will the new earth be like?

Micah 4:8 “And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of

Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\____; the kingdom shall

come to the daughter of Jerusalem.”

NOTE: It will be like the first dominion. It will be like The Garden of Eden

before sin entered. It will be a beautiful place.

7) What kind of bodies will the redeemed have in heaven?

Philippians 3:21 “Who shall change our \_\_\_\_ body, that it may be fashioned

like unto his \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_, according to the working whereby he is able

even to subdue all things unto himself.”

NOTE: We will have immortal bodies that are not subject to decay and death.

8) Will physical handicaps still exist in heaven?

Isaiah 35:3-6 “Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God

will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and

save you. Then the eyes of the \_\_\_\__ shall be opened, and the ears of the

\_\_\_\_\_ shall be unstopped. Then shall the \_\_\_\_\___ man leap as an hart, and

the tongue of the \_\_\_\__ sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and

streams in the desert.”

NOTE: Those who are physically challenged will be challenged no longer. Their

health will be restored in full vigor. They will be filled with joy because they will

be completely healed. 

9) What will the redeemed be doing in heaven?

Isaiah 65:21-23 “And they shall \_\_\_\_\_\_ houses, and \_\_\_\_\_\__ them ; and they

shall \_\_\_\_\_\_ vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and

another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a

tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of

their hands. They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for

they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.”

NOTE: The redeemed will build the homes of their dreams, and will plant the

gardens that they have always wanted. It will be a wonderful time.

10) What will the animal kingdom be like in heaven?

Isaiah 65:25 “The \_\_\_\_ and the \_\_\_\_ shall feed \_\_\_\_\_\__, and the lion shall eat

straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent' meat. They shall not

hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.”

NOTE: Today in our world, the wolf and the lamb cannot be together in one

place. When the earth is made new there will be no killing of animals. The very

nature of animals as we know it today will be changed. The whole face of nature

will be changed. It will be pure peace without any hidden agendas. I am looking

forward to be in a place like that!

11) What will our relationship with Jesus be like?

Revelation 22:3-4 “And there shall be no more \_\_\_\__: but the throne of God

and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: And they

shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.”

NOTE: We will delight to serve God, a God whom we will love in return for what

He has so lovingly done for us.

12) How can you enter into the city of New Jerusalem?

Revelation 21:7-8 >“He that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shall inherit all things; and I will be

his God, and he shall be my son. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the

abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and

idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with

fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”

NOTE: Here we have a description of those who are allowed inside the city, and

those who will not be in the city. Needless to say, the great majority will be

outside of the city. God calls us to be over comers, to overcome sin and its

power. This has already been accomplished through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. He

wants to work through us to give us the victory over our sinful nature. 

13) What is the invitation for us today?

Revelation 22:17 “And the Spirit and the bride say, \_\_\_\_\_\_. And let him that

heareth say, \_\_\_\__. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let

him take the water of life \_\_\_\_\_\_.”

NOTE: God does not force or coerce us to do what He wants us to do. He is

gentle and allows us the see why we should follow Him. I appreciate this about

God so much. There are many people on the planet today that manipulate, that

force and push others to do their bidding. I am happy that God is not like that.

He says, “I love you. I want you to follow me so you will be happier, so you will

be free. But it is up to you.” I can freely serve a God like that.

IS IT YOUR DESIRE…

To make plans to be on the earth made new? Yes or No
