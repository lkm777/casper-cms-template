1) What is God’s Character really like?

Jeremiah 31:3 “The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying , Yea, I

have \_\_\_\__ thee with an everlasting \_\_\_\_: therefore with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ have I

drawn thee.”

NOTE: God’s character is one of love and compassion. He loved the world so

much that He sent His son here on a mission to die to save us. This is a very

important fact to keep in our minds as we begin to study this subject.

2) How many people does God want to perish?

2 Peter 3:9 “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men

count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that ___ should

\_\_\_\_\_\_, but that ___ should come to repentance.”

NOTE: God does not want anyone to perish! In fact, He wants all to come to

repentance.

3) How is our God described?

Hebrews 12:29 “For our God is a consuming ___.”

NOTE: Although Our God loves, He also is a consuming fire. Sin cannot exist in

the presence of God.

4) What will ultimately happen to sinners?

Psalm 37:10 “For yet a little while, and the wicked \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_ : yea, thou

shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be .”

Psalm 37:20 “But the wicked shall \_\_\_\_\_\_, and the enemies of the LORD

shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__; into \_\_\_\__ shall they

\_\_\_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\__.”

Malachi 4:1-3 “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall \_\_\_\_ as an oven; and

all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be \_\_\_\_\_\__: and the day

that cometh shall \_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\_ __, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave

them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun

of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and

grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\__ the wicked; for they

shall be \_\_\_\__ under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this , saith

the LORD of hosts.”

NOTE: One day sinners will be burnt to ashes. They will be completely

destroyed. They will cease to exist.

5) But, I thought the Bible taught “everlasting punishing?”

Matthew 25:46 “And these shall go away into everlasting \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: but

the righteous into life eternal.”

NOTE: There is a big difference between the words punishing and punishment.

Punishing is something that is ongoing. It is taking place in the present tense.

Punishment is punishing that comes to an end. Jesus is speaking of “everlasting

punishment.” In other words, the results of that particular punishment will be

eternal. The punishment itself isn’t ongoing for eternity. This is very important

because it influences how we see who God is. If you think that God will burn

people for billions and billions of years, then you will serve God so that you will

not be tortured for eternity. But if you understand that the punishment of the

wicked reaches an end, then you begin to serve God out of heartfelt love toward

Him.

6) What is the result of eternal fire?

Jude 7 “Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like

manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh,

are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ \_\_\_\__.”

2 Peter 2:6 “And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into \_\_\_\_

condemned them with an overthrow, making them an \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ unto those

that after should live ungodly;”

NOTE: What is the result of eternal fire? Simply put, the result of eternal fire is

ashes. Today Sodom and Gomorrha are not burning. Rather, they were turned to

ashes. Eternal fire results in everlasting punishment, not everlasting punishing.

(Mal. 4:3)

7) What does the term, “unquenchable fire” mean?

Matthew 3:11-12 “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he

that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear:

he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: Whose fan is in his

hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the

garner; but he will burn up the chaff with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ fire.”

NOTE: Again, in harmony with what the Bible says in other places, the term

“unquenchable fire” means a fire that cannot be quenched.

Is this the first time the Bible uses this term? Let’s see how the phrase

“unquenchable fire” is used in the next question. 

8) How is the phrase “unquenchable fire” used in other places of the Bible?

Jeremiah 17:27 “But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the Sabbath

day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on

the Sabbath day; then will I kindle a \_\_\_\__ in the gates thereof, and it shall

devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__.”

NOTE: This fire in Jerusalem was not quenched, but this fire has burnt out. That

is precisely the point. An “unquenchable fire” is a fire that cannot be put out.

What eventually happens to a fire that is not put out? It stops burning. In this

case, it turns to ashes.

9) What about the verse that speaks of the wicked burning forever?

Revelation 20:10 “And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of

fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be

tormented day and night \_\_\_ \_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_.”

Exodus 21:6 “Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also

bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his

ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him \_\_ \_\___.”

1 Samuel 1:22, 28 “But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband,

I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he

may appear before the LORD, and there abide \_\_\_ \_\_\_… Therefore also I

have lent him to the LORD; as \_\_\_\_ as he \_\_\_\___ he shall be lent to the

LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.”

Jonah 2:6 “I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her

bars was about me \_\_\_ \_\_\___: yet hast thou brought up my life from

corruption, O LORD my God.”

NOTE: The word or phrase “for ever” many times in the Bibles refers to

something that has already ended. In the case of Jonah, he was in the belly of the

whale for three days, and yet he said it was, “for ever.” It may have seemed like

to him it was forever. Likewise for the wicked when hellfire occurs it will seem

like forever, because they refused the free gift of life that was offered to them.

10) Who is hell fire prepared for?

Matthew 25:41 “Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart

from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the \_\_\_\__ and his

\_\_\_\__:”

NOTE: Hellfire was not prepared for us. God does not desire to destroy human

beings. Hellfire was prepared for the devil and his angels. But, sadly, many

people will partake in that fire because they followed the evil one instead of Jesus

Christ.

11) Where will hellfire take place?

Psalm 11:6 “Upon the wicked he shall \_\_\_\_ snares, \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\__, and an

horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.”

Revelation 20:9 “And they went up on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ of the earth, and

compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came

down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.”

NOTE: Many people today believe that hellfire is burning right now, and it is

burning at the center of the earth. But this is not correct. The fires of hell will

burn on the surface of the earth. At the end of the millennium after the Holy City,

the New Jerusalem, descends from heaven to earth.

12) What does the Bible call God’s act in destroying the wicked?

Isaiah 28:21 “For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be

wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work;

and bring to pass his act, his \_\_\_\_\_\__ act.”

NOTE: Indeed, it is a strange act for God to destroy the wicked. He is a being of

pure love that only wants the best for His creatures. One day it will be better for

those that He loves to be destroyed than to be in heaven. If they would be

allowed to enter there they would not enjoy it. In fact, they would welcome

destruction. This is why the strange act of God, in destroying the wicked, is

actually a loving act. If the wicked were forced to live in heaven it would not be

love.
